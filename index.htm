            <p>I am a father of three and have been happily married for 13 years. I am in the Software Development
                program set to graduate in Fall of 2026.
                I have worked for Frito Lay for the past 7 years as a Route Sales Representative. My hobbies include
                spending time with my family, video games, and working with my hands on projects like
                woodworking and puzzles.
            </p>
